About Sojurn
------------

Sojurn keeps track of what TV shows you've watched, and which ones you haven't. It features a backlog so you know what episodes you haven't watched yet, and a timeline that lets you see when your favorite shows will air next. 

You can explore your favorite shows, browsing by season and episode.

- Backlog : The backlog shows what shows you have added but not watched yet.

- Timeline : The timeline lets you view what shows you have added that are upcoming.

Why was it made?
----------------

Sojurn was originally deveoped to explore new technology, it's since been adapted to ensure you can track your tv watching no matter how you view. If you view a show on regular tv, Netflix, or streaming over the internet, Sojurn provides you a platform to keep track of what you have seen, as well as track when new content is released.


About the code
--------------

Sojurn is written in C# using WPF and MVVM. 


Requires .NET Framework 4.6.

Data Sources
------------

Currently the data used is from the TVMaze API. Sojurn has been written to easily allow the injection of different data sources, so if you'd prefer another feel free to add it.


v2.0 
------------

This was a large change to the UI, but your old index.json files will still work just fine.
